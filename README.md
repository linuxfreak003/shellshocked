Different shells, so far C and OCaml

The C code is mostly copied over from [this blog](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/)

I started the C code to learn more about creating a shell. Plan to work on the OCaml code and possibly develop it into something.

Python code may even end up here eventually if I get bored and feel like doing something.

To run use makefile.
`make jsh` or simply `make` to create the binary.
`make clean` will remove auxilary files, `make deepclean` will remove binaries as well.
