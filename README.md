Different shells, so far C, OCaml and Python

The C code is mostly copied over from Stephen Brennan's blog [here.](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/)

I started the C code to learn more about creating a shell.
The OCaml code was to get a little bit of experience and become more familiar with OCaml. The python code is just to add another language.

I will likely add Go next.

To run in C
* `make jshc` to compile the C code into a binary.

To run in OCaml
* `make jsh` or simply `make` to create the native binary from OCaml.

To run in Python
* `python3 shell.py` - you must have python3 installed
